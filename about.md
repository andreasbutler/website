Hello! I am a fourth-year Mechanical Engineering Undergraduate at Georgia Institute of Technology with a double minor in Computer Science and Robotics. In my college career, I have been part of three research groups and four different projects all related to robotic systems. These experiences have fostered strong skills with: teamwork, mechanical design, CNC machining, and coding.  

I am captivated by the unique way in which robotics combines mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science concepts to a powerful and unprecedented effect, and I am enthralled by the idea of pushing robotic capabilities to the brink of what is possible.  

Within the field of robotics, I have recently developed an interest in the mathematical/dynamical analysis, optimization, and control of robotic systems, and their importance to experimental applications. A memorable experience during my most recent work at Caltech was seeing the application of mathematical theory to the physical product, and seeing the dynamical and controls equations come to life.
