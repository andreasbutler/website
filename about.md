At the moment, I'm very excited about the relationship between low level controllers and online planning algorithms, and the guarantees that can be made in a combined framework. I am also interested in the application of model predictive control as a tool to achieve bipedal locomotion, and how it can be paired with offline trajectory optimization to improve runtime efficiency and increase the complexity of behaviors. Please feel free to reach me over email if these are similarly of interest to you!
