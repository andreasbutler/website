## Table of Contents

# Black Tea Base 
* 4 Quarts Water
* 8 Tea Bags [Lipton Black Tea]
* 1 Cup Sugar
* 1 Cup Starter Liquid

Bring the water to a boil with sugar. Steep Tea (5:30 min) then cool to room temp. (Alternate: steep tea until tea cools to room temp.) Add scoby and starter. Let sit for 7-14 days until barely sweet. During summer months this has averaged 9 days for me. 

# Strawberry Pineapple
* Some strawberries
* Some pineapple
* Ginger
* Black Tea Base

Blend the strawberries, pineapple, and ginger in whatever ratio you like. Add 1-2" of puree to fermentation grade bottles (ratio is for full size bottles). Add the tea base. Let sit for 3 days out at room temperature, then refrigerate for a day or two. I had major success recently with carbonation retention and flavor using this recipe.

# Lemon-Lime
* Some Lemons
* Some Limes
* Lemonade
* Ginger
* Black Tea Base

Juice lemons and limes, mix with lemonade. Add 10% juice to bottle with some julianned ginger. Fill remaining room with tea. Let sit for a week. 

## Notes on Results
If it does not sit long enough in second fermentation, it does not get carbonated. Some bottles carbonate better than other bottles. If it's too acidic, it will not carbonate (but will still taste good). Mediocre in comparison with most recent results. See above.
