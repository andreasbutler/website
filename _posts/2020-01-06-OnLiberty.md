"The danger which threatens human nature is not the excess, but the deficiency, of personal impulses and preferences....
In other times, from the highest class of society down to the lowest, everyone lives as under the eye of a hostile and dreaded censorship. 
Not only in what concerns others, but in what concerns only themselves, the individual or the family do not ask themselves, what do I prefer?
or, what would suit my character and disposition? or, what would allow the best and highest in me to have fair play and enable it to grow and thrive?
They ask themselves, what is suitable to my position? 
what is usually done by persons of my station and pecuniary circumstances? or (worse still) what is usually done by persons of a station and circumstance superior to mine?
I do not mean that they choose what is customary in preference to what suits their own inclination. 
It does not occur to them to have any inclination except what is customary.
Thus the mind itself is bowed to the yoke: even in what people do for pleasure, conformity is the first thing thought of;
they like in crowds;
they exercise choice only among things commonly done;
peculiarity of taste, eccentricity of conduct are shunned equally with crimes, until by dint of not following their own nature they have no nature to follow:
their human capacities are withered and starved; they become incapable of any strong wishes or native pleasures, and are generally without wither opinions or feelings of home growth, or properly their own. Now is this, or is it not, the desirable condition of human nature?"
