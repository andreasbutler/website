## Morphism
A morphism is a strucutre-preserving map between mathematical structures of the same type.
## Isomorphism
A bijective morphism.
## Homomorphism
A mapping between two algebraic objects, which preserves operation in those objects. 
## Homeomorphism
A topological isomorphism. In other words, it is a continuous function between topological spaces with continuous inverse.
## Diffeomorphism
A differentiable homeomorphism.

## Examples
Let $(G, * )$ and $(H,\cdot)$ be two groups. A group homomorphism is a map $\rho:G\to H$ that satisfies $\rho (a*b)=\rho(a)\cdot \rho(b)$. If $\rho$ is bijective, then it is a group isomorphism. In this case, $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic, written as $G\cong H$.
