Add something about conservative vs nonconservative system

# Introduction
Consider the mechanical system given by
<img class="center" style="margin-top:20px" src="https://noelc-s.github.io/website/img/Pendulum/pend.svg?sanitize=true">
where $J$ is the moment of inertia, $\theta$ represents the angular deviation from vertical, $b$ represents the damping coefficient, and $u$ represents a force input in the positive $\theta$ direction.
# Dynamics
## Euler-Lagrange
For the following discussion, we will assume that the control input, $u$, is zero. The kinetic energy of the system, $T=\frac{1}{2}J\dot{\theta}^2$, and the potential energy of the system $V=mgl(1-\cos(\theta)$. We can therefore construct the Lagrangian as
\\[
\begin{align}
L&=T-V\notag\\\
&=\frac{1}{2}J\dot{\theta}^2-mgl(1-\cos(\theta)).\notag
\end{align}
\\]
We can represent the damping force as a Rayleigh dissipation function with $\mathcal{F}=\frac{1}{2}b\dot{\theta}^2$. This given us a force in the generalized coordinates of 
\\[
Q_i = -\frac{\partial\mathcal{F}}{\partial\dot{\theta}}=-b\dot{\theta}.
\\]
Employing the Lagrange d'Alembert principle results in the equations of motion of the system, as given by
\\[
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial v^i}\right)-\frac{\partial L}{\partial q^i}&=Q_i\notag\\\
\ddot{\theta}+\frac{mgl}{J}\sin(\theta)&=-b\dot{\theta}\notag.
\end{align}
\\]
In order to represent the system in a convenient manner, we use state space representation to construct 
\\[
\dot{q} = \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}q_2\\\\ -\frac{mgl}{J}\sin(q_1)-bq_2\end{bmatrix}}_{f(q)}
\\]
where $q=(\theta,\ \dot{\theta})^\top$.

## Solutions
There does not exist a closed form solution for all initial conditions for all time of the pendulum in terms of elementary functions [1](http://www.pgccphy.net/ref/nonlin-pendulum.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3J14EOjnxSJZzAtsxGCJ7bMh9NJCMdY3RlSBmt9buxUxfeAQz1GiX-mLM). This however does not mean that we cannot characterize certain aspects of the system, which we will do in subsequent sections.

## Multiple Isolated Fixed points
Unlike linear systems, nonlinear systems can exhibit behaviors of multiple isolated fized points, which the pendulum well demonstrates. Setting $f(q)=0$, we have that $q_1=n\pi$, $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ with $q_2=0$, meaning the system has an infinite number of fixed points. We will later see through a geometric analysis that this can be reduced to two true states of the system with $q_1\in\\{0,\pi\\}$.

## Linearization
The first thing we can do to determine some characteriztics of the system is to perform a linearization of the system around the fixed points. Starting with $q_0\equiv 0$, we compute the Jacobian
\\[
A(q_0) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial q}(q_0)=\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\\ -\frac{mgl}{J}\cos(q_1) & -b\end{bmatrix}(q_0) = \begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\\ -\frac{mgl}{J} & -b\end{bmatrix}.
\\]
Now with $q_\pi = \pi$, we get
\\[
A(q_\pi) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial q}(q_\pi)=\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\\ -\frac{mgl}{J}\cos(q_1) & -b\end{bmatrix}(q_1) = \begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\\ \frac{mgl}{J} & -b\end{bmatrix}.
\\]
### Hartman-Grobman Theorem
Essentially, the [Hartman-Grobman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartman%E2%80%93Grobman_theorem) theorem states that if the Jacobian matrix of $f$ at a fixed point has no eigenvalue purely on the imaginary axis, then there exists a homeomorphism that maps a neighborhood of the fixed point to $\mathbb{R}^n$. Additionally, the linear system is tangent to the flow of the nonlinear system "around" the fixed point. In our system, the eigenvalues of $A$ are not purely imaginary granted that $b$ is not zero.

Insert images of linear and nonlinear system.
## Local Stability
We can caluclate the eigenvalues of the linearization to determine the stability of the system about its fixed points. Let $\Delta_0=\frac{1}{J}(Jb^2-4glm)$ and $\Delta_\pi=\frac{1}{J}(Jb^2+4glm)$. For $A_{q_i}$, $i\in\\{0,\pi\\}$, we have $\lambda_1 = \frac{-b-\Delta_1}{2}$ and $\lambda_2 = \frac{\Delta_i-b}{2}$. For $A_{q_0}$, the system is stable, but fow $A_{q_\pi}$, the system is unstable, which matches intuition; an upright pendulum falls over, whereas a freely swinging pendulum will eventually come to rest and the origin. By the Hartman-Grobman theorem, we know that the nonlinear system exhibits similar behavior around the fixed points. Show mapping. This is where global and local picture should go.

## Lyapunov
We will construct a candidate Lyapunov function from the Hamiltonian (total energy) of the system
\\[
V(q) = H(\theta, \dot{\theta}) =\frac{1}{2}J\dot{\theta}^2+mgl(1-\cos(\theta)).
\\]
In order to determine the stability of the system, we differentiate $V(q(t))$ as in
\\[
\begin{align}
\dot{V}(q(t)) &= \frac{dV}{dq}f(q) = mgl\sin(\theta)\dot{\theta} + J\dot{\theta}\ddot{\theta} \notag\\\
&= mgl\sin(\theta)\dot{\theta}-J\dot{\theta}(\frac{mgl\sin(\theta)}{J}+b\dot{\theta}) \notag \\\
&= -b\dot{\theta}^2 <0.\notag
\end{align}
\\]
Because $V$ is a positive definite function, and its derivative is negaitve definite (if b is nonzero), the system is locally asympotically stable.

 Something seems wrong about this. $\pi$?
### La Salle's Theorem 
## Differential Geometry
The configuration manifold of the system is $\mathbb{S}^1$. Because $\mathbb{S}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}\backslash\~$ where $~$ represents the equivalence class given by $\mathcal{R}={2\pi n}, n\in\mathbb{Z}$, the phase portrait should repeat iself every $2\pi$. Because $\mathbb{S}^1$ is a Lie group, the configuration manifold of this system is parallelizable, meaning $TQ\cong\mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{R}$. An interesting aside is that if we considered the $n$ pendulum (i.e. the connected pendulum with $n$ degrees of freedom), if $n$ were even, the configuration manifold would not be parallelizable by the [Hairy Ball Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_ball_theorem). In dynamical systems, the phase space of the system lies on tangent bundle, $TQ$.
