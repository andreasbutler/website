## Ratio
I keep 100g of an 80% hydration starter recipe on hand that I feed daily with:
* 40% water (85-90 F)
* 40% white
* 10% whole wheat
* 10% starter

You can store it in the fridge for long periods of time and not have to worry about it. I feed it before putting it in the fridge and give it an afternoon to warm up and a day to get back to steady state (likely unnecessary -- could probably just use it right out of the fridge) before using it.
