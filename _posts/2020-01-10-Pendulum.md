# Introduction
Consider the mechanical system given by
<img style="margin:20px 20px" src="https://noelc-s.github.io/website/img/Pendulum/pend.svg?sanitize=true">
where $J$ is the moment of inertia, $\theta$ represents the angular deviation from vertical, $b$ represents the damping coefficient, and $u$ represents a force input in the positive $\theta$ direction.
# Dynamics
## Euler-Lagrange
For the following discussion, we will assume that the control input, $u$, is zero. The kinetic energy of the system, $T=\frac{1}{2}J\dot{\theta}^2$, and the potential energy of the system $V=mgl(1-\cos(\theta)$. We can therefore construct the Lagrangian as
\\[
\begin{align}
L&=T-V\notag\\\
&=\frac{1}{2}J\dot{\theta}^2-mgl(1-\cos(\theta)).\notag
\end{align}
\\]
We can represent the damping force as a Rayleigh dissipation function with $\mathcal{F}=\frac{1}{2}b\dot{\theta}^2$. This given us a force in the generalized coordinates of 
\\[
Q_i = -\frac{\partial\mathcal{F}}{\partial\dot{\theta}}=-b\dot{\theta}.
\\]
Employing the Lagrange d'Alembert principle results in the equations of motion of the system, as given by
\\[
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial v^i}\right)-\frac{\partial L}{\partial q^i}&=Q_i\notag\\\
\ddot{\theta}+\frac{mgl}{J}\sin(\theta)&=-b\dot{\theta}\notag.
\end{align}
\\]
In order to represent the system in a convenient manner, we use state space representation to construct 
\\[
\dot{q} = \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}q_2\\\\ -\frac{mgl}{J}\sin(q_1)-bq_2\end{bmatrix}}_{f(q)}
\\]
where $q=(\theta,\ \dot{\theta})^\top$.
## Solutions
There does not exist a closed form solution for all initial conditions for all time of the pendulum in terms of elementary functions. This however does not mean that we cannot characterize certain aspects of the system, which we will do in subsequent sections.

Insert numerical solutions.
## Multiple Isolated Fixed points
Unlike linear systems, nonlinear systems can exhibit behaviors of multiple isolated fized points, which the pendulum well demonstrates. Setting $f(q)=0$, we have that $q_1=n\pi$, $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ with $q_2=0$, meaning the system has an infinite number of fixed points. We will later see through a geometric analysis that this can be reduced to two true states of the system with $q_1\in\\{0,\pi\\}$.

## Linearization
The first thing we can do to determine some characteriztics of the system is to perform a linearization of the system around the fixed points. Starting with $q_0\equiv 0$, we compute the Jacobian
\\[
A(q_0) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial q}(q_0)=\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\\ -\frac{mgl}{J}\cos(q_1) & -b\end{bmatrix}(q_0) = \begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\\ -\frac{mgl}{J} & -b\end{bmatrix}.
\\]
Now with $q_\pi = \pi$, we get
\\[
A(q_\pi) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial q}(q_\pi)=\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\\ -\frac{mgl}{J}\cos(q_1) & -b\end{bmatrix}(q_1) = \begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\\ \frac{mgl}{J} & -b\end{bmatrix}.
\\]
### Hartman-Grobman Theorem
Essentially, the [Hartman-Grobman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartman%E2%80%93Grobman_theorem) theorem states that if the Jacobian matrix of $f$ at a fixed point has no eigenvalue purely on the imaginary acies, then there exists a homeomorphism that maps a neighborhood of the fixed point to $\mathbb{R}^n$. Additionally, the linear system is tangent to the flow of the nonlinear system "around" the fixed point. In our system, the eigenvalues of $A$ are not purely imaginary granted that $b$ is not zero.

## Lyapunov
We will construct a candidate Lyapunov function from the Hamiltonian (total energy) of the system
\\[
V(q) = H(q_1, q_2) =\frac{1}{2}J\dot{\theta}^2+mgl(1-\cos(\theta)).
\\]
In order to determine the stability of the system, we differentiate $V(q(t))$ as in
\\[
\begin{align}
\dot{V}(q(t)) &= \frac{dV}{dq}f(q) = mgl\sin(\theta)\dot{\theta} + J\dot{\theta}\ddot{\theta} \notag\\\
&= mgl\sin(\theta)\dot{\theta}-J\dot{\theta}(\frac{mgl\sin(\theta)}{J}+b\dot{\theta}) \notag \\\
&= -b\dot{\theta}^2 <0.\notag
\end{align}
\\]
Because $V$ is a positive definite function, and its derivative is negaitve definite (if b is nonzero), the system is stable.
## Differential Geometry
The configuration manifold of the system is $\mathbb{S}$. Because $\mathbb{S}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}\backslash\~$ where $~$ represents the equivalence class given by $\mathcal{R}={2\pi n}, n\in\mathbb{Z}$, the phase portrait should repeat iself every $2\pi$. Because $\mathbb{S}^2$ is a Lie group, the configuration manifold of this system is parallelizable, meaning $TQ\cong\mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{R}$. An interesting aside is that if we considered the $n$ pendulum (i.e. the connected pendulum with $n$ degrees of freedom), if $n$ were even, the configuration manifold would not be parallelizable by the [Hairy Ball Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_ball_theorem). In dynamical systems, the phase space of the system lies on tangent bundle, $TQ$.
