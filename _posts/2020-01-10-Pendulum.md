# Introduction
Consider the mehcanical system given by
<img style="margin:20px 20px" src="https://noelc-s.github.io/website/img/Pendulum/pend.svg?sanitize=true">
where $J$ is the moment of inertia, $\theta$ represents the angular deviation from vertical, and $u$ represents a force input in the positive $\theta$ direction.
# Dynamics
## Euler-Lagrange
The kinetic energy of the system, $T=\frac{1}{2}J\dot{\theta}^2$, and the potential energy of the system $V=mgl(1-\cos(\theta)$. We can therefore construct the Lagrangian as
\\[
\begin{align}
L&=T-V\notag\\\
&=\frac{1}{2}J\dot{\theta}^2-mgl(1-\cos(\theta)).\notag
\end{align}
\\]
Employing the Euler-Lagrange equations results in the equations of motion of the system, as given by
\\[
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial v^i}\right)-\frac{\partial L}{\partial q^i}&=0\notag\\\
\ddot{\theta}+\frac{mgl}{J}\sin(\theta)&=0\notag.
\end{align}
\\]
In order to represent the system in a convenient manner, we use state space representation to construct 
\\[
\dot{q} = \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}q_2\\\\ -\sin(q_1)\end{bmatrix}}_{f(q)}
\\]
where $q=(\theta,\ \dot{\theta})^\top$.
## Solutions
There does not exist a closed form solution for all initial conditions for all time of the pendulum in terms of elementary functions. This however does not mean that we cannot characterize certain aspects of the system, which we will do in subsequent sections.
## Linearization
We can perform a linearization of the system around the fixed point $q_0\equiv 0$ by computing the Jacobian
\\[
A(q_0) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial q}(q_0)=\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\\ \cos(q_1) & 0\end{bmatrix}(q_0) = \begin{bmatrix}0&1\\\\ 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}
\\]
