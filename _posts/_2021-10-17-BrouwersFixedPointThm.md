# Statement
Every continuous function $f:D^n\to D^n$ has a fixed point, i.e. a point $x\in D^n$ such that $f(x) = x$.
## Proof
There are many ways to prove the above statement, but an especially elegant method utlizies the notion of homology. We begin by assuming for the sake of contradiction that such a continuous function $f$ exists with no fixed points. This would guarantee that the points $x,f(x) \in D^n$ are distinct. As such, it would be possible to construct a retraction $r:D^n \to S^{n-1}$ from the disk to its boundary $\partial D^n = S^{n-1}$ via a ray from $f(x)$ passing through the $x$ to $S^{n-1}$, as depicted below:

Defining the inclusion map as $i:S^{n-1}\to D^n$, the retraction $r$ would be a continuous function such that $r\circ i=id_{S^{n-1}}$. This can be depicted diagramatically as:

In order to validate our original claim of the nonexistence of $f$, we must show that a continuous map $r$ cannot exist. Proving the non-existence of functions is generally hard to do -- as such, we will turn to algebraic invariants. 
### Chain Complexes
We can derive chain complexes from topological spaces in the following way: Let $X$ be a topological space. Let $C_n$ for $n\in\mathbb{N}$ be the free abelian group generated by $n$-simplices in $X$.
### Singular Homology

Singular homology can be considered a functor from the category of chain complexes to the category of abelian groups.

Apyling the reduced singular homology functor, we

After some calculations, we can replace the above diagram with the following:
