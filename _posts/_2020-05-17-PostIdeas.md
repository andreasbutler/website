* A geometric intuition of lagrange duality
* Why gold gets its color and relativistic effects of d orbitals
* why defects are the most reactive and orbitals sticking out
* The shape of the orbitals from the wave equation
* Group theory and crystallography
* Boost up the Lie Theory page with some group theory
* Make the math terms page a page of examples instead of copying wikipedia
* Robust MPC (RSRG slides)
* Poincare Duality, dual topological structures
* Beautiful Work: Jenna, Tai Bradley, crane
* memes
* Why save money in grad school: Don't
* Safety and Stability
* Nonlinear Controllability and an Intuitive Explanation of Frobenius Theorem
* Euler discretization preserves controllability, (lin then disc)
* Euler discretization and first order taylor approximation commute!
