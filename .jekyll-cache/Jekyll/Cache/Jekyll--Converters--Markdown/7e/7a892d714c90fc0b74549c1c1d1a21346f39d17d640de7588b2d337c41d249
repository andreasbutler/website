<h1 id="black-tea-base">Black Tea Base</h1>
<ul>
  <li>4 Quarts Water</li>
  <li>8 Tea Bags [Lipton Black Tea]</li>
  <li>1 Cup Sugar</li>
  <li>1 Cup Starter Liquid</li>
</ul>

<p>Bring the water to a boil with sugar. Steep Tea (5:30 min) then cool to room temp. (Alternate: steep tea until tea cools to room temp.) Add scoby and starter. Let sit for 7-14 days until barely sweet. During summer months this has averaged 9 days for me.</p>

<h1 id="strawberry-pineapple">Strawberry Pineapple</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Some strawberries</li>
  <li>Some pineapple</li>
  <li>Ginger</li>
  <li>Black Tea Base</li>
</ul>

<p>Blend the strawberries, pineapple, and ginger in whatever ratio you like. Add 1-2‚Äù of puree to fermentation grade bottles (ratio is for full size bottles). Add the tea base. Let sit for 3 days out at room temperature, then refrigerate for a day or two. I had major success recently with carbonation retention and flavor using this recipe.</p>

<h1 id="lemon-lime">Lemon-Lime</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Some Lemons</li>
  <li>Some Limes</li>
  <li>Lemonade</li>
  <li>Ginger</li>
  <li>Black Tea Base</li>
</ul>

<p>Juice lemons and limes, mix with lemonade. Add 10% juice to bottle with some julianned ginger. Fill remaining room with tea. Let sit for a week.</p>

<p>If it does not sit long enough in second fermentation, it does not get carbonated. Some bottles carbonate better than other bottles. If it‚Äôs too acidic, it will not carbonate (but will still taste good). Mediocre in comparison with most recent results. See above.</p>
