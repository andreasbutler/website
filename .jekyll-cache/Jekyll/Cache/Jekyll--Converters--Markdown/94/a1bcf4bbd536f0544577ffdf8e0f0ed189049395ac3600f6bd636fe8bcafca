<p>At the moment, Iâ€™m very excited about the relationship between low level controllers and online planning algorithms, and the guarantees that can be made in a combined framework. I am also interested in the application of model predictive control as a tool to achieve bipedal locomotion, and how it can be paired with offline trajectory optimization to improve runtime efficiency and complexity of behaviors.</p>
