<p>I keep 100g of an 80% hydration starter recipe on hand that I feed daily with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>40% water (85-90 F)</li>
  <li>40% white</li>
  <li>10% whole wheat</li>
  <li>10% starter</li>
</ul>

<p>You can store it in the fridge for long periods of time and not have to worry about it. I feed it before putting it in the fridge and give it an afternoon to warm up and a day to get back to steady state (likely unnecessary â€“ could probably just use it right out of the fridge) before using it.</p>
